### <h1 align="center" id="title">IGM module `optimize` </h1>

# Description:

A data assimilation module of IGM permits to seek optimal ice thickness, top ice surface, and ice flow parametrization, that best explains observational data such as surface ice speeds, ice thickness profiles, top ice surface while being consistent with the ice flow iflo_emulator used in forwrd modelling. This page explains how to use the data assimilation module as a preliminary step in IGM of a forward/prognostic model run with module `optimize`.

**Note that the optimization currently requires some experience, and some parameter tunning may be needed before getting a meanigfully results. Use it with care, and with a certain dose of parameter exploration. Do not hesitate to get in contact with us for chcecking the consistency of results.**

# Getting the data 

The first thing you need to do is to get as much data as possible. Data list includes:

* Observed surface ice velocities ${\bf u}^{s,obs}$, e.g. from Millan and al. (2022).
* Surface top elevation $s^{obs}$, e.g. SRTM, ESA GLO-30, ...
* Ice thickness profiles $h_p^{obs}$, e.g. GlaThiDa
* Glacier outlines, and resulting mask, e.g. from the Randolph Glacier Inventory.

Of course, you may not have all these data, which is fine. You work with a reduced amount of data, however, you will have make assumptions to reduce the number of variables to optimize (controls) to keep the optimization problem well-posed (i.e., with a unique solution).

Thes data can be obtained using the IGM module `oggm_shop`, or loading these 2D gridded variables using module `load_ncdf` or `load_tif` using convention variable names but ending with `obs`. E.g. `usurfobs` (observed top surface elevation), `thkobs` (observed thickness profiles, use nan or novalue where no data is available), `icemaskobs` (this mask from RGI outline serve to enforce zero ice thickness outside the mask), `uvelsurfobs` and `vvelsurfobs` (x- and y- components of the horizontal surface ice velocity, use nan or novalue where no data is available), `thkinit` (this may be a formerly-inferred ice thickness field to initalize the inverse model, otherwise it would start from thk=0).

**Use the IGM `oggm_shop` to download all the data you need using OGGM and the GlaThiDa database.**
 
# General optimization setting

The optimization problem consists of finding spatially varying fields ($h$, $c$, $s$) that minimize the cost function $$ \mathcal{J}(h,c,s)=\mathcal{C}^u+\mathcal{C}^h+\mathcal{C}^s+\mathcal{C}^{d}+\mathcal{R}^h+\mathcal{R}^{c}+\mathcal{P}^h, $$

where $\mathcal{C}^u$ is the misfit between modeled and observed surface ice velocities ($\mathcal{F}$ is the output of the ice flow iflo_emulator/neural iflo_network):
$$\mathcal{C}^u=\int_{\Omega}\frac{1}{2\sigma_u^2}\left|{\bf u}^{s,obs}-\mathcal{F}(h,\frac{\partial s}{\partial x},\frac{\partial s}{\partial y},c)\right|^2,$$

where $\mathcal{C}^h$ is the misfit between modeled and observed ice thickness profiles:
$$\mathcal{C}^h=\sum_{p=1,...,P} \sum_{i=1,...,M_p}\frac{1}{2 \sigma_h^2}|h_p^{obs}(x^p_i, y^p_i)-h (x^p_i, y^p_i)|^2,$$

where $\mathcal{C}^s$ is the misfit between the modeled and observed top ice surface:
$$\mathcal{C}^s=\int_{\Omega}\frac{1}{2 \sigma_s^2}\left|s-s^{obs}\right|^2,$$

where $\mathcal{C}^{d}$ is a misfit term between the flux divergence and its polynomial 
regression $d$ with respect to the ice surface elevation $s(x,y)$ to enforce smoothness with  dependence to $s$:
$$\mathcal{C}^{d}=\int_{\Omega}\frac{1}{2 \sigma_d^2}\left|\nabla \cdot (h {\bar{\bf u}})-d \right|^2,$$

where $\mathcal{R}^h$ is a regularization term to enforce anisotropic smoothness and convexity of $h$:
$$\mathcal{R}^h=\alpha_h\int_{h>0}\left(|\nabla h \cdot \tilde{{\bf u}}^{s,obs} |^2+\beta|\nabla h \cdot (\tilde{{\bf u}}^{s,obs})^{\perp} |^2-\gamma h\right),$$

where $\mathcal{R}^{c}$ is a regularization term to enforce smooth c:
$$\mathcal{R}^{c}=\alpha_{\tilde{A}}\int_{\Omega}|\nabla c|^2,$$

where $\mathcal{P}^h$ is a penalty term to enforce nonnegative ice thickness, and zero thickness outside a given mask:
$$\mathcal{P}^h=10^{10} \times \left(\int_{h<0} h^2+\int_{\mathcal{M}^{\rm ice-free}} h^2 \right).$$

Check at the reference paper given below for more explanation on the regularization terms.

# Define controls and cost components

The above optimization problem is given in the most general case, however, you may select only some components according to your data as follows: 

* the list of control variables you wish to optimize, e.g., 
```json
"opti_control": ['thk','slidingco','usurf'] # this is the most general case  
"opti_control": ['thk','usurf'] # this will only optimize ice thk and top surf 
"opti_control": ['thk'] # this will only optimize ice thickness 
```
* the list of cost components you wish to minimize, e.g.
```json
"opti_cost": ['velsurf','thk','usurf','divfluxfcz','icemask']  # most general case  
"opti_cost": ['velsurf','icemask'] # Here only fit surface velocity and ice mask.
```

**I recomend to start with a simple optimization, starting with one single control (typically `thk`), and a few target/cost component (typically `velsurf` and `icemask`), and then to increase the complexity of the optimization (adding controls and cost components) once the the most simple give meaningfull results. Make sure to keep a balance between controls and constraints to ensure the problem to keep the problem well-posed, and prevents against multiple solutions.**

# Exploring parameters

There are parameters that may need to tune for each application.

First, you may change your expected confidence levels (i.e. tolerance to fit the data) $\sigma^u, \sigma^h, \sigma^s, \sigma^d$ to fit surface ice velocity, ice thickness, surface top elevation, or divergence of the flux as follows:

```json
"opti_velsurfobs_std": 5 # unit m/y
"opti_thkobs_std" : 5 # unit m
"opti_usurfobs_std" : 5 # unit m
"opti_divfluxobs_std": 1 # unit m/y
```

Second, you may change regularization parameters such as i) $\alpha^h, \alpha^A$, which control the regularization weights for the ice thickness and strflowctrl (increasing $\alpha^h, \alpha^A$ will make thse fields spatially smoother), or ii) parameters beta and gamma involved for regularizing the ice thickness h. Taking beta=1 occurs to enforce isotropic smoothing, reducing beta will make the smoothing more and more anisotropic to enforce further smoothing along ice flow directions than accross directions (as expected for the topography of a glacier bedrock, which was eroded over long times). Setting parameter gamma to a small value may be usefull to add a bit of convexity in the system. This may help when initializing the inverse modelled with zero thickness, or to treat margin regions with no data available. These parameters may be changed as follows:

```json 
"opti_regu_param_thk": 10.0            # weight for the regul. of thk
"opti_regu_param_slidingco": 1.0     # weight for the regul. of slidingco
"opti_smooth_anisotropy_factor": 0.2
"opti_convexity_weight":  0.002
```

Lastly, there are a couple of other parameters we may be interest to change e.g.

```json
"opti_nbitmax": 1000   # Number of it. for the optimization
"opti_step_size": 0.001  # step size in the optimization iterative algorithm
"opti_init_zero_thk": True   # Force init zero ice thk (otherwise take thkinit)
```

# Monitoring the optimization

You may monitor the data assimilation during the inverse modelling in several ways:

* Check that the components of the costs decrease over time, the value of cost are printed during the optimization, and a graph is produced at the end.
* Set up parameter `plot_result` to  True and `plt2d_live` to True to monitor in live time the evolution of the field your are optimizing such as the ice thickness, the surface ice speeds, ect ... You may also check (hopefully decreasing) STD given in the figure.
* You may do the same monitoring after the run looking at optimize.nc reuesting this file to be written.
* If you asked divfluxfcz to be in the parameter list `opti_cost`, you should check what look like the divergence of the flux (divflux).
