### <h1 align="center" id="title">IGM avalanche module  </h1>

# Description:

This IGM module permits to model redistribution of snow due to avalanches.
This routine move ice/snow downslope until the ice surface is everywhere
at angle of repose. This function was adapted from 
[Mark Kessler's GC2D](https://github.com/csdms-contrib/gc2d)
program and implemented in IGM by JÃ¼rgen Mey with support from Guillaume Jouvet.
