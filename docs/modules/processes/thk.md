# thk

This IGM module solves the mass conservation of ice to update the thickness from ice flow (computed from module `iceflow`) and surface mass balance (given any module that update `smb`). The mass conservation equation is solved using an explicit first-order upwind finite-volume scheme on the 2D working grid. With this scheme mass of ice is allowed to move from cell to cell (where thickness and velocities are defined) from edge-defined fluxes (inferred from depth-averaged velocities, and ice thickness in upwind direction). The resulting scheme is mass conservative and parallelizable (because fully explicit). However, it is subject to a CFL condition. This means that the time step (defined in module `time`) is controlled by parameter parameter `time_cfl`, which is the maximum number of cells crossed in one iteration (this parameter cannot exceed one), see the documentation of module `time`. A bit more details on the scheme are given in the following paper.
