# Need Help?

For any IGM-related questions, you can reach out to the community through the Discord channel. Just send an email to guillaume.jouvet@unil.ch to request access to the IGM Discord chat.

If you need support or feedback from others (such as developers), and you're experiencing an issue, you may need to share your setup. In that case, it is crucial to provide a **fully reproducible** and **well-organized** setup folder to facilitate communication and save time. To that end, please provide a download link to a setup folder with the following structure:

- A sub-folder (e.g., `experiment`) with the parameter file
- A sub-folder (e.g., `data`) with the input data (if any)
- A sub-folder (e.g., `user`) with the user modules  (if any)
- a README file that includes 
   + The exact version of IGM (tag or version to check out)
   + The command to run in order to reproduce the error (e.g., `igm_run experiment=params`)
   + A description of the issue
   + (Optional) The version of external libraries, if relevant (e.g., TensorFlow, xarray, etc.)
