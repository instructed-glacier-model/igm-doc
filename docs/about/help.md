## Support Guidelines

If you require assistance or feedback from developers or other users, and you are encountering an issue, it is essential to share a **fully reproducible** and **well-organized** setup folder. This will streamline communication and save time. Please provide a download link or even better an access to a github repository with a setup folder structured as follows:

- A sub-folder (e.g., `experiment`) containing the parameter file.
- A sub-folder (e.g., `data`) containing the input data (if applicable).
- A sub-folder (e.g., `user`) containing user modules (if applicable).
- A README file that includes:
   - The exact version of IGM (tag or version to check out).
   - The command to run to reproduce the error (e.g., `igm_run experiment=params`).
   - A clear description of the issue.
   - (Optional) The version of external libraries, if relevant (e.g., TensorFlow, xarray, etc.).
